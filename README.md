## Getting Started

This is the first draft of a website that I am building for a friend. It uses NextJS with a postgres database and maps though the items to create the pages for you following a layout template. I have also created it with a Neon Database or with a docker postgres database that can take full functionality of pushing to the database and changing prices or descriptions of items. I also enabled Auth0 authentication and created an admin dashboard to edit items, add new items, and check orders.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployed on VPS. 

This will be deployed after bugs are fixed on a VPS so it can be accessed globally.
